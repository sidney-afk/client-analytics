# Track B — Replacing Linear with in-app production management

**Parent doc:** `INDEPENDENCE_PLAN.md`. **Safety doctrine:** `ROLLBACK.md` (applies in full to
every phase below). **Ground-truth audits:** `docs/audits/2026-07-05-*.md` — the mandatory deep
re-audit (live Linear / n8n / Supabase / Sheets diffs vs 2026-07-03, plus the four **logic maps**:
`2026-07-05-logic-calendar.md`, `-logic-samples.md`, `-logic-reviews.md`, `-logic-sync.md`).
Read `2026-07-05-reaudit-summary.md` first — it indexes the 20 findings that shaped this revision.

**Status: PLANNING — verified & hardened against the 2026-07-05 re-audit, then adversarially
re-reviewed by four independent critic passes (execution-readiness / worst-case / consistency /
fact-check) with all confirmed findings folded in. Owner sign-off needed on §14 decisions before
B0.** Track A is complete (A1/A2/A4 merged; A3 skipped by decision — the Linear bridges die with
Linear) but its Edge-Function flags are **TEST-only**: rolling every real client onto the EF write
paths is now an explicit Track B prerequisite phase (§6.2, "B0.5").

> **MANDATORY RE-AUDIT before any code.** These facts are a **2026-07-05** snapshot. Re-pull and
> diff before B0 (the pattern is established: `docs/audits/2026-07-05-*` diffed vs `-07-03-*`).
> Never trust a cited line number — re-locate by symbol.

**Sizing facts (2026-07-05, MEASURED — replaces the 2026-07-03 estimates):**
- 2 live teams (Graphics/GRA, Video/VID); 4 dormant (CON/ALE/PC/EA). `workload_issues` also
  contains CON + STR rows — see §2.9.
- **89 non-archived Linear projects ≈ 75 unique client names** (was misread as 48). ~51 carry
  `slackChannelId`; ~15 carry real brand-kit descriptions; ~14 have ghost (removed-user) leads.
- **1,869 open issues** (GRA 470 / VID 1,399), of which **841 sit in Backlog/Triage outside
  cycles**. Open-by-createdAt: ≤3 mo = 697, ≤6 mo = 924, ≤12 mo = 1,045, older = **824 (44%
  zombies)**. ~17.5k closed issues lifetime (estimate, id-interpolated, upper bound — hard-deleted
  ids exist). ~120 new sub-issues/week (**and therefore Linear's own id counters advance ~100/wk
  per team — never hardcode identifier seeds, §10.3**). Measured id ceilings 2026-07-03:
  VID-12815 / GRA-6578. 497 open issues are overdue; 336 review-state issues are >3 months old.
- 5 rostered editors/designers, **4 active** (martin idle since Jun 6 with assigned stale WIP).
- Fields used on deliverables: **state, assignee, due date, comments** — plus **priority, which is
  in use again** on July batches (§14 D-3). Labels, estimates, attachments, milestones unused.
- Real interactive write volume is small: ~25 calendar upserts, ~41 status pushes, ~27 inbound
  Linear events, ~69 sample upserts per day. Throughput is a non-issue; **correctness is the game.**

## 0. Locked decisions (owner) — with 2026-07-05 reality annotations

1. **Rollout = two-phase parallel run** (§1). Never true bidirectional sync — exactly one
   authoritative side per team at any moment; the mirror flows one direction only.
2. **Migration = operational + archive split** (§5). Live/open work becomes editable
   `deliverables`; all remaining history goes to a **read-only archive** so nothing is lost.
   *(Annotation: cut on createdAt/completedAt, never updatedAt — bulk touches poisoned updatedAt;
   see §5.1.)*
3. **Client single source of truth = the Supabase `clients` table** (§3). *(Annotation: the
   reconcile set is 89 projects / ~75 names, plus a 4th source nobody counted — the SMM sheet
   tab; see §3.)*
4. **Auth is built first (B0)** (§6). Client review links stay no-login. *(Annotation: there are
   **no tokens to move** — the sheet column never existed and every client link fails open today.
   §6.4 becomes mint-and-re-issue, with a `client-token-verify` EF for the read gate.)*
5. **UI/interaction design is LOCKED** (§10) — the pixel/behavior-matched prototype in
   `docs/syncview-design/`. The build wires logic to it; it does not redesign it. In Phase 1 the
   mirror must reflect Linear **exactly** until authority flips; the simpler feature set is a
   *view* choice, never data loss (see §2.4 `linear_raw`).
6. **Deliverable ↔ card are interconnected** (§9): deep links both ways, origin labels, and
   **title == card name** (incl. YouTube titles — verified: *the YouTube title IS
   `calendar_posts.name`*; no separate field exists).
7. **Comments go internal** (§9.5): review feedback lands in Supabase threads the editors read
   in-app, mirrored to Linear only during transition. *(Annotation: refined into a concrete
   single-writer design in §9.5; ratify in §14 D-6.)*
8. Carried from earlier: 3-role auth not per-person (D6); Slack now, ro.am later (D8); everything
   attributable with timestamps (D7); keep the team's exact status vocabulary (§2.1 canonicalizes
   it — the "exact vocabulary" turns out to be three conflicting vocabularies today).

---

## 1. The spine — two-phase parallel run

The governing safety rule: **there is always exactly one authoritative side per team, and the
mirror is one-directional. We never run true two-way sync.**

| Phase | Authoritative side | Mirror direction | New tab is | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B0** Auth + scaffolding | Linear (unchanged) | none | not built | role keys, client tokens, flip-log, monitoring skeleton, vocabulary lock |
| **B0.5** EF rollout | Linear (unchanged) | none | not built | **all real clients onto the Track A Edge-Function write paths** (§6.2) — prerequisite for every auth/ledger claim below |
| **B1** Data model + backfill | Linear (unchanged) | none | not built | schema, operational+archive migration, client reconcile |
| **B2** Build surface | Linear (unchanged) | none | built, flag-hidden | Production tab behind `?prod=1`, role-gated |
| **B3** *Phase 1 — Evaluation mirror* | **Linear** | Linear → Supabase (inbound) | **read-only live mirror** | editors keep real work in Linear, try the new tab; zero risk |
| **B4** *Phase 2 — Authoritative pilot* | **Supabase** (per pilot team) | Supabase → Linear (outbound) | **authoritative** for the pilot team | pilot team works in the new tab; Linear kept current as fallback |
| **B5** New-only + teardown | Supabase | none (Linear frozen) | authoritative for all | Linear cold read-only fallback for a grace period, then archive + cancel |

**1.1 Authority is a runtime flag, not a deploy.** One new key in `syncview_runtime_flags`:
`prod_authority` = `{"video":"linear","graphics":"linear"}` (B3 default) → `"supabase"` per team
at each B4 flip. Consumed by the same proven `_calRuntimeFlagClients`-style machinery
(realtime-updated), read by: the FE Linear-push gates (§4.5), the card link-button resolver
(§9.2), the inbound engine (§4.3), the outbound mirror (§4.4), the legacy reconcilers and the
gated n8n bridges (§4.5). Flipping a team = **one SQL update**; rollback = the same update
reversed. Two hardening rules from the critic pass:
- **Fail-safe direction is phase-aware, not constant-`linear`.** A flag-read failure must never
  silently reassign authority: every consumer caches the last-known-good value (localStorage /
  process memory) and keeps using it on read failure, with a loud alert; a cold client with no
  cached value **freezes Linear-facing writes** (explicit "sync paused — reload" UX) rather than
  guessing. (A constant `linear` default would, after a flip, quietly re-enable Linear pushes and
  point editors back at frozen Linear.)
- **Drill granularity:** `prod_authority_client_overrides` = `{"sidneylaruel":{"video":"supabase"}}`
  (TEST-only, same shape discipline as the Track A flags) lets the §12 flip drill run end-to-end
  on the TEST client/project **without** flipping a whole team in production. Consumers check the
  override first, then the team value.
Because `syncview_runtime_flags.updated_at` is **provably not maintained on update** (re-audit
F3), B0 adds a `BEFORE UPDATE` stamp trigger **and** the `flag_flips` append-only log (§2.2).

**1.2 Per-team authority in B4:** a deliverable's authority = override ??
`prod_authority[deliverable.team]`. Cross-team edges (a GRA thumbnail under a VID batch —
routine, bidirectional) follow **the deliverable's team**, never the batch's. **Batch-level
fields** (name/description/links/status/comments) follow `batches.team`; a genuinely mixed or
mirrored-pair batch (`team=null` or both `linear_parent_ids` present) freezes batch-field edits
to **admin only** while its teams' authorities disagree, and the outbound mirror never writes a
Linear parent belonging to a still-Linear-authoritative team (§4.4).

**1.3 "Exact reflection" in B3 — what it actually requires.** Today's inbound path is
**status-only**. B3's mirror must also reflect **title, due date, assignee, priority, parent,
archived/deleted state, and comments** — none of which have any inbound path today. This is a NEW
inbound engine (§4.3). Comments additionally require a **new Linear webhook subscription for the
Comments resource** (the existing webhooks are Issues-only) — an owner action in Linear settings
at B3 (§4.3.4, also a named B3 gate item). Fields the UI doesn't show are preserved verbatim in
`deliverables.linear_raw` (§2.4).

**1.4 Known divergence windows in B3 (documented, accepted; the §8.1 diff must tolerate them):**
(a) the calendar refuses stale Linear regressions and never adopts unmapped states — the
Production tab can briefly disagree with a calendar card *by design*; (b) due-date churn from the
degraded ~23:45 UTC roller (§14 D-9) and `linear-set-status`'s **+2d overdue bump side effect**;
(c) **clamped states**: a sample-linked deliverable cannot represent `scheduled`/`posted` (§2.1)
— if the Linear issue lands there anyway, the inbound engine stores it in `linear_raw`, flags the
row (`payload.clamped`), displays a clamped badge, and the reconciler counts it as tolerated, not
drift; (d) **unknown assignees**: issues assigned to ghost/removed users compare by
`linear_raw` user id in the reconciler (mirror fidelity), and land on the repair list instead of
the diff count — otherwise one stale-WIP ghost blocks the 7-day zero-diff gate forever.

**1.5 The B3→B4 flip checklist (per team, one team at a time)** — expanded with the re-audit's
hidden-writer inventory and the critic findings:

1. Announce freeze to the team (the freeze is social; steps 5–8 are the technical net).
2. Quiesce app-side outbound: verify both localStorage outboxes are **drained on every staff
   browser** via the B2 staff diagnostic page (§10.7 — it reads both outbox keys; note
   `peekLinearOutbox()` exists today but an SXR peek helper does **not** and must be shipped in
   B2; the only SXR console helper today is the destructive `clearSxrLinearOutbox()`).
3. Final inbound reconcile; verify **zero diff** for that team (statuses, assignees — via raw
   user id, due dates modulo §1.4 tolerances, titles, engine-tracked comments per §8.1) **and
   zero cards carrying a Linear link with no `*_deliverable_id`** (linkage completeness, §4.3.5).
4. Flip `prod_authority[team]='supabase'` (logged in `flag_flips` + `EXECUTION_LOG.md` +
   ROLLBACK.md Live State row updated in the same PR).
5. Verify every legacy writer is gated for that team: FE push gates (§4.5), `MJbMZ`'s
   calendar/samples branches, **both reconcile scripts** (skip / detect-only for
   Supabase-authoritative teams — they are bidirectional writers and MUST be gated, or a
   straggler Linear edit re-enters through `pullLinearToCard` within 10 minutes), and the
   **n8n `linear-set-status` / `linear-add-comment` webhooks themselves** (server-side
   `prod_authority` check inside each — one snapshotted n8n edit per workflow — so stale-JS tabs
   and late outbox flushes are refused centrally, not just client-side).
6. Enable the outbound mirror for that team; probe a full create→status→comment→due round trip
   on the TEST project.
7. Repoint the card link buttons + status-pill lock predicate + **the Kasper-queue visibility
   gates** (§9.2 — the unlinked-graphic gates at `_calCompKasperVisible` and twins; missing this
   silently drops every new thumbnail out of Kasper review) for that team; probe: a new
   Linear-link-less sample appears in the Kasper queue.
8. **Leave inbound running in detect-only mode for the flipped team**: events are not applied;
   they are logged to `deliverable_events` (`source='mirror', action='foreign_write_detected'`)
   and Slack-alerted — catching the straggler editor still writing in Linear for the whole
   B4+B5 grace period.
9. Verify the native identifier sequence for the team is seeded **above the live Linear max at
   flip time + margin** and collides with nothing in `linear_archive`/`deliverables` (§10.3).
10. Rollback rehearsal (ROLLBACK rule 7): flip back, confirm Linear-authoritative flow works,
    flip forward again — before the team starts real work.

**1.6 Per-phase flip point, snapshot, and Live-State discipline (ROLLBACK rules 1/4 + the
Live-State mandate apply to every phase, not just B1):**

| Phase | Single flip point (kill switch) | Rollback |
|---|---|---|
| B0 | `auth_enforcement` runtime flag (`permissive` ⇄ `enforced`) | set back to `permissive` |
| B0.5 | the three `*_ef_clients` flags (per client) | remove client from flag → n8n path |
| B1 | additive tables only; no behavior flip | drop nothing; old world untouched |
| B2 | `?prod=1` + role gate (tab hidden by default) | hide tab (flag) |
| B3 | `linear_inbound_enabled` runtime flag (+ webhook disable in Linear as the hard kill) | set false / disable webhook |
| B4 | `prod_authority[team]` | flip back to `linear` |
| B5 | each teardown step is its own reversible action (§13) | reactivate the n8n workflow / webhook |

Every phase: snapshot per ROLLBACK rule 4 before starting, and update ROLLBACK.md's Live State
table **in the same PR** as the change. **n8n exports NEVER go to the public repo** — the
Phase-0 precedent is the rule: raw workflow JSON (which contains hardcoded keys) goes to the
private Drive backup folder; the repo gets a public-safe status stub in `n8n-backups/`
(clarified in ROLLBACK.md rule 2).

---

## 2. Data model (the new database)

**Hierarchy:** two **teams** (`video`, `graphics`) → **clients** (team-agnostic) → **batches**
(a shoot/batch; primary team recorded, cross-team children legal) → **deliverables** (one video /
one thumbnail; team-scoped).

Additive-only (ROLLBACK rule 3). Verified collision-free against the live schema. **Default
posture for any table not explicitly classified below: RLS on, zero policies (service-role
only)** — the safe default. Writes are Edge-Function-only, role/token-gated (§6). Realtime
publication adds: `clients`, `team_members`, `batches`, `deliverables`, `deliverable_events`,
`flag_flips`.

### 2.1 Reference: the canonical status vocabulary (fixes the previous draft's broken CHECK)

| Canonical **slug** (stored) | Display name (locked design) | Card component status (`CAL_STATUSES`) | Linear state names (per team, legacy) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `triage` | Triage | — (**inbound → no-op today**; adopting a Triage→In-Progress projection would be a deliberate divergence — D-2 ratifies) | Triage (VID only) |
| `backlog` | Backlog | — (inbound → `In Progress`) | Backlog |
| `todo` | Todo | — (inbound → `In Progress`); **outbound from card `In Progress` maps here (legacy asymmetry)** | Todo |
| `in_progress` | In Progress | In Progress | In Progress |
| `smm_approval` | For SMM approval | For SMM Approval | "For SMM approval" (both teams) |
| `kasper_approval` | For Kasper approval | Kasper Approval | "For Kasper approval" (both) |
| `tweak` | Tweak Needed | Tweaks Needed | GRA "Tweak Needed" / VID **"Tweak Needed "** (trailing space) |
| `client_approval` | For Client Approval | Client Approval | GRA "For Client approval" / VID "For Client Approval" |
| `approved` | Approved | Approved | Approved |
| `scheduled` | Scheduled | Scheduled (calendar only; samples clamp — §1.4c) | Scheduled |
| `posted` | Posted | Posted (calendar only; samples clamp) | Posted |
| `canceled` | Canceled | — (inbound → no-op today) | Canceled |
| `duplicate` | Duplicate | — (inbound → no-op) | Duplicate |

Rules locked here (B0 ratifies, §14 D-2): store **slugs**; map Linear→slug by **state UUID
first, normalized name second** (trim + case-fold + substring — the `_calMapLinearStatusStrict`
tolerance); map slug→Linear by the per-team state-UUID table captured at B0. Projection slug→card
status per the table. Clamping for `origin='samples'` rows per §1.4c. **Outbound mapping split
(D-10):** the legacy *card-projection* path keeps today's asymmetry (card `In Progress` → Linear
Todo) for mirror exactness until B5; the *deliverable-native* outbound op (§4.4) maps straight
(`in_progress` → Linear "In Progress") — both stated so the builder never has to guess.

**Card linkage:** add to BOTH `calendar_posts` and `sample_reviews`: `video_deliverable_id text`,
`graphic_deliverable_id text` (nullable, additive; a card has two production slots exactly as it
has two Linear link slots). These columns must ride every write path that carries the Linear link
columns today: the EF ALLOWED lists, `KASPER_PATCH_SCALARS`, the n8n upsert ALLOWED arrays, and
`_CAL_ROLLBACK_FIELDS`. Linkage is **maintained continuously**, not backfilled once (§4.3.5).

### 2.3 Why relational integrity gives "change once, updates everywhere"

`deliverables` is the single row per task; due/assignee/status/title changes fan out to board,
workload, and calendar card via realtime on that one row + the card projection (§9.6).

### 2.4 `linear_raw` and the §1 lossless promise

`linear_raw jsonb` (+ `priority`, + verbatim `linear_archive.raw`) is where every Linear field
the UI hides still lives. It also holds the **pre-B3 comment history** for operational issues
(§5.1) — rendered as a read-only "Linear history" block in the activity feed, never imported into
live card threads. Post-B5 it freezes as historical context.

### 2.5 Timestamps/types

New tables use real types. Comment **threads** stay JSON-in-`text` deliberately: byte-compatible
with the existing card threads and merge RPCs. New RPC clones: `deliverable_merge_comments`
(manual-deliverable threads) and `batch_merge_comments` (batch threads) — clones of
`sample_review_merge_comments`, service-role-only, same tombstone semantics.

### 2.6 The ledger must be un-bypassable — concrete mechanism (critic-hardened)

Measured failure mode: 100% of today's 22k sample events are `source='ui'` — inbound/reconciler
writers have always bypassed the n8n-code-node ledger. Fix, concretely: **every deliverable/batch
write goes through a single Postgres function** `deliverable_write(...)` / `batch_write(...)`
(security definer, service-role-execute-only) that performs the row write **and** the event
insert **in one transaction**, setting `set_config('app.event_written','1',true)`. An
`AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE` trigger on `deliverables` **and** `batches` checks the (transaction-
local) marker and, when absent — i.e., any writer that bypassed the RPC, including a raw
service-role UPDATE — inserts a baseline event (`source='system', actor=null`). This works
*because* marker and trigger share the transaction; EFs therefore MUST write via these RPCs, not
via bare PostgREST updates (stated here so the builder doesn't reproduce the two-request pattern
that would make the marker invisible and double-log every write). CI asserts: (a) RPC write → 1
event; (b) raw UPDATE → 1 system event; (c) never 2.

### 2.7 Anon-exposure policy (explicit, with a safe default)

**Default for unlisted tables: service-role only.** Anon-readable (parity with the app's read
model): `clients`, `team_members`, `batches`, `deliverables`, `deliverable_events`, `flag_flips`.
Service-role only: `client_access`, `mirror_outbox`, **`linear_archive`** (17.5k issues of
internal feedback, client briefs, and delivery links must not be one anonymous REST call away —
the archive UI reads through a role-gated EF, §10.7), and every future table unless this section
is amended. `team_members.email` exposure is accepted and recorded (already public in audit docs).
Cross-client `using(true)` reads remain standing Phase-4 debt, not worsened by Track B.

### 2.8 Flags trigger

B0 migration adds the `BEFORE UPDATE` stamp trigger on `syncview_runtime_flags` + the
`flag_flips` insert trigger (§1.1).

### 2.9 CON/STR scope statement

`workload_issues` contains four team keys — VID 1,495 / GRA 562 / CON 15 / STR 13 rows (**totals
over all 2,085 rows**; the active-only split per team was not measured — measure it at B1 before
the D-11 decision). Track B models video+graphics only. Recommendation (§14 D-11): CON/STR out of
deliverables scope, included in `linear_archive` at B5, filtered explicitly by the workload
repoint (§9.10).

## 3. Client single source of truth

**The measured problem:** "who are our clients?" has **four** answers today — the hardcoded seed
(**30 names**; the *effective* roster is 33 after the sheet merge), the Clients Info sheet (29
rows), Linear projects (89 non-archived ≈ 75 unique names), and the SMM sheet tab (which knows a
client the app has never seen). Live slug sets: `calendar_posts` 21, `caption_prompts` 25,
`workload_issues.client_name` 56 messy variants.

**The fix:** the `clients` table becomes the boss list.

- **Reconciliation (one-off, B1):** union all four sources keyed by normalized slug — the
  normalizer is **`wlNormalizeClient` ported exactly** (index.html:9001: lowercase, strip
  accents, strip leading "dr.", and/&→`&`, strip other non-alphanumerics).
- **Duplicate Linear projects merge:** `clients.linear_project_ids` holds ALL project ids per
  client (up to 3 measured), incl. the two live split projects (Baya Voce VID + GRA).
- **Special rows seeded at B1:** Kasper Hytonen (`kind='internal'`), Sidney Laruel
  (`kind='test'`), and **`unattributed`** (`kind='internal'`, `active=true` — the repair-queue
  home for the 137 open issues with no project; visible in staff UI, excluded from client-facing
  pickers by `kind`). The roster cutover query stays `where active` (today's effective roster
  already includes the internal/test rows).
- **Owner review list (B1 gate):** 26 three-source clients; 3 sheet-only (Jenna Phillips
  Ballard, Alayna Bellquist, Amanda Hanson); 4 seed-only (Nobriga + Marks → `active=false`;
  Kasper internal; Sidney test); **Jessica Encell Coleman** (SMM+Linear only — owner call);
  **Morgan Burch** (sheet-active vs Linear-Completed — owner call); `terrinamar`/`terrinammar`
  merge (canonical `terrinammar`); junk quarantine (Test Project, Client Example, Onboarding
  Ale, Synchro House…). Expect ~30+ `active=false` entries.
- **Tokens:** §6.4 — minted, not moved.
- **Roster cutover (late, B4→B5):** `getClientRoster()` (index.html:9066) re-points to
  `select slug, display_name from clients where active` — one line, reversible.
- **Slack channels:** seed from Clients Info (26/29) cross-checked against Linear projects
  (~51); conflicts to the owner list.

## 4. The sync engine (the heart, and the riskiest part)

Three components — **inbound engine** (Linear→Supabase, B3+), **outbound mirror**
(Supabase→Linear, B4+ per team), **continuous reconciler v2** (§8.1) — all driven by the
authority flag (§1.1), all idempotent, all ledger-writing.

### 4.1 Direction is never ambiguous

For a given team exactly one side is authoritative; the engine only writes **away from** the
authoritative side. Batch-field edge case per §1.2.

### 4.2 Loop prevention (extended with the echo cases we will actually hit)

Every write carries `source`; the mirror ignores `mirror`-sourced changes. Two measured echo
channels get explicit treatment:

- **B4 outbound echo:** the mirror's own Linear writes come back as webhook deliveries ~1 s
  later. Drop rule = **strict AND**: (webhook actor == the mirror's own Linear identity) AND
  (payload equals the op recorded in `mirror_outbox`/ledger for that issue — value match, not
  just actor match). The mirror identity must be **distinct from sidney@** (a dedicated Linear
  user or OAuth-app actor — sidney@ is the legacy house identity used by n8n and by real humans;
  actor-only matching against it would swallow legitimate writes). §14 D-18.
- **B3 comment echo (the loop the critics caught):** the legacy comment mirror
  (`linear-add-comment`, house key, sidney@) keeps running through B3 — so every SyncView review
  comment appears in Linear ~1 s later, and the new Comments webhook would re-import it into the
  same card thread as a duplicate (which the legacy `is_tweak`-absent⇒true default would then
  count as an open tweak, corrupting the resolve/queue machinery). The inbound comment path
  therefore **drops** comments that are (authored by the legacy integration identity) AND (body
  matches the `**{…} (via SyncView):**` prefix convention), and keeps an idempotency check
  against recent `comment_add` ledger payload ids. sidney@'s *manual* Linear comments (no
  prefix) still flow in.

### 4.3 Inbound engine (new EF `linear-inbound`)

1. **Transport:** new Linear webhooks (per team) → EF; HMAC-SHA256 verification + ~60 s replay
   guard. Kill switch: `linear_inbound_enabled` flag (§1.6) + webhook disable as the hard stop.
   The existing `MJbMZ` webhooks/workflow keep running untouched for the card patches until B5.
2. **Field scope:** state (UUID→slug), title, dueDate, assignee (via `linear_user_id`/email;
   unknown → null + `payload.unknown_assignee` + repair list, §1.4d), priority, parent change,
   archive/restore, **delete** (webhook `remove`), team move (alias push into `linear_aliases`;
   `linear_issue_uuid` stays the key). Clamped states per §1.4c. Unknown state UUID → verbatim
   into `linear_raw` + `payload.unmapped_state` + Slack alert.
3. **Inbound comments:** full object pinned explicitly — `{role:'editor', audience:'internal',
   is_tweak:false, done:false, round:null, parent_id:null, author:<Linear display name>,
   body:<markdown verbatim>}` (the pinning matters: the legacy reader treats an *absent*
   `is_tweak` as TRUE). Echo filtering per §4.2. Image URLs stored as-is (expiring — §14 D-12).
4. **Comments webhook activation (owner action, B3 gate item):** subscribe the Comments resource
   in Linear settings; then **immediately re-run the §5.1 operational pull** (catch-up — webhooks
   only deliver from subscription time, and B1→B3 spans weeks at ~120 new issues/wk).
5. **Card-linkage maintenance (continuous, not one-off):** on issue create/update, resolve the
   issue's URL/uuid against card Linear-link columns (and vice versa on card link_set events via
   the card EFs) and keep `video_deliverable_id`/`graphic_deliverable_id` current. Reconciler v2
   carries a linkage lane ("0 cards with a Linear link and no deliverable id"). Without this,
   every card created during B2–B4 is status-dead at the flip (measured failure mode).
6. **Writer:** everything lands via `deliverable_write()`/`batch_write()` RPCs (§2.6) with
   `source='mirror'`, `action='mirror_in'` + specific action.
7. **Detect-only mode** per flipped team (§1.5.8).

### 4.4 Outbound mirror (new EF `linear-outbound` + `mirror_outbox`, B4 per team)

- **Trigger:** the write EF commits → synchronous Linear push attempt → on failure
  `sync_state='pending'` + `mirror_outbox` row. Retry worker (GH Actions cron ~5 min; pg_cron
  fallback) drains with backoff; `attempts>8` → `sync_state='error'` + Slack. Durable retry is
  server-side, deliberately not localStorage.
- **Ops:** issue create (batch parent create on first deliverable — only on the deliverable's
  own team, and never a parent on a Linear-authoritative team, §1.2), state update
  (**deliverable-native mapping: straight, incl. `in_progress`→"In Progress"** — §2.1/D-10),
  title/due/assignee update, comment create (`**{Actor} (via SyncView):**\n\n{body}` — the live
  convention `linear-tweak-comments` parses), archive.
- **Identity & secrets:** dedicated Linear key/actor distinct from sidney@ (§4.2, D-18), stored
  as EF secret. **Rate limits:** Linear's budget dwarfs ~70 writes/day; worker caps 1 op/s,
  backs off on 429.
- **Dropped side effect:** the +2d overdue bump is NOT replicated (D-8).
- **Not synced:** labels/estimates/cycles; the archive; priority (inbound-only).

### 4.5 The legacy pipes during transition (measured dependencies — gate, don't guess)

Untouched through B3: `MJbMZ789B5ExZz9x` (the A1/A2 EF flag routing lives inside it), both
reconcilers, `linear-set-status`/`linear-add-comment`, FE push sites. At each B4 team flip, ALL
of these gate on `prod_authority[team]` (see §1.5.5 — including the reconcilers and the two n8n
webhooks server-side). n8n edits follow the snapshot rule (§1.6 — private export + public stub;
most Linear bridges have NO current repo backup, incl. `rhDX5` edited 06-29). FE gates live in
the two push helpers + two comment helpers + two reassert loops + outbox flushers (**flushers
re-check the flag at flush time**, so a queued item never fires at a frozen side); the full
9-path fan-in inventory with symbols is `2026-07-05-logic-sync.md` §implications-1. Stale-JS
protection: B2 ships a `min_app_version` runtime flag + forced-reload banner so a flip can expire
tabs loaded before the gate code deployed (GitHub Pages caches ~10 min; a tab can live for days).

### 4.6 Conflict handling (rescoped honestly)

"One authoritative side" removes **cross-system** conflicts; it does not remove **human**
concurrency inside Supabase (two SMMs; SMM + Kasper on the same deliverable). The deliverable
write contract therefore carries compare-and-set: `expected_status` (for transitions) and/or
`expected_updated_at`; on mismatch the EF returns 409 + current row, the FE refetches and shows
"someone else just changed this" (the card contract's `comments_base_at` discipline, applied to
scalars). Comment threads already merge (RPCs). The B3→B4 flip instant is handled by §1.5.
Last-write-wins remains the backstop only.

### 4.7 Failure answers (detect → contain → recover → never lose)

| Failure | Detect | Contain | Recover | Data loss |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sync loop (echo re-applied) | §4.2 strict-AND drop + flap alert (same field >N/hr) | per-team single direction | reconciler v2 settles to authoritative side | none (ledger has every hop) |
| Partial mirror failure | `sync_state` + outbox depth + Slack | Supabase (authoritative) stays correct; mirror lags | outbox retries; manual replay tool | none |
| Linear down (B3) | inbound silence + reconciler failures | mirror stale (banner via last-event age) | **webhook redelivery is limited** (Linear retries briefly and can auto-disable the webhook) — recovery = reconciler v2 **applying** corrections + §8.2 webhook-enabled probe; not redelivery hope | none |
| Linear down (B4) | outbox depth alarm | pilot team unaffected | outbox drains on recovery | none |
| Supabase down | FE read failures; health check | B3: editors keep working in Linear; B4: degraded read-only (§7.4); **writes are refused loudly** (no background client queue — consistent with §4.4's removal of localStorage outboxes) | outbox/reconciler verify on recovery | none if refusals are loud; PITR/exports cover storage loss |
| Comment lost in mirror | engine-tracked comment map (§8.1) | authoritative store written first | re-push from thread (idempotent by comment id) | none |
| Client renamed mid-flight | rename event | slugs immutable; display-only rename | — | none |
| Editor assigned to deleted batch/card | FK + soft-delete cards | archive view renders | reassign UI; foreign-write alert | none |
| Status change with no actor | §2.6 trigger + actorless-event alert | — | ledger + `flag_flips` forensics | none |
| Backup can't restore | §7.5 rehearsal BEFORE B4 (gate artifact) | — | PITR/export | bounded by tested RPO |
| Straggler Linear write after flip | detect-only inbound alert (seconds) | not applied | manual merge via tab | none (event holds payload) |
| Stale-JS tab / closed-laptop outbox fires post-flip | server-side gates in the n8n bridges refuse it (§1.5.5); refusals logged | centrally refused regardless of client state | `min_app_version` forced reload | none |
| EF platform outage | "not saved" chips + health probe | reads unaffected; pre-B4 n8n paths unaffected | explicit user retry | none |
| Realtime outage | staleness watchdog → banner + poll | SWR refetch-on-focus | auto-heals | none |
| Flag corruption / unreadable | consumer validation; last-known-good cache (§1.1) | freeze writes on cold-no-cache; never reassign authority silently | fix flag; `flag_flips` forensics | none |
| Backfill crash mid-run | idempotent + re-runnable; dry-run counts gate | additive tables; old world untouched | re-run; verify counts | none |
| Archive pull rate-limits production bridges | §5.2 throttle budget + off-hours schedule | resume tokens | resume | none |
| DB nears 500 MB cap | monthly usage check | archive `raw` ~50–150 MB (fits) | prune `linear_raw` post-B5 / upgrade (D-1) | none |

## 5. Migration & backfill (B1)

Two pulls from Linear GraphQL, idempotent (keyed on `linear_issue_uuid`), re-runnable, each with
`--dry-run` producing the counts/samples report that is the B1 gate evidence.

### 5.1 Operational pull → live `batches` + `deliverables`

- **Definition:** open AND `createdAt` within cutoff (3 mo → 697 / **6 mo → 924 (recommended)** /
  12 mo → 1,045 / all-open → 1,869), plus any open issue linked from a live card. Never
  `updatedAt` (poisoned, measured).
- **Pre-migration cleanup (D-4):** owner-triage the 824 zombies + 336 stale-WIP in Linear first.
- **Batch shapes (all measured-real):** mirrored pairs (identical title+description → ONE batch
  row, both `linear_parent_ids`); single-team parents; mixed-team children; cross-team children
  both directions; orphan sub-issues → per-client synthetic "(no batch)"; **137 no-project
  issues** → parent's project, else title parse, else the `unattributed` client (visible repair
  queue, B1 gate reviews it).
- **Fields:** status per §2.1 (state UUID), assignee via `team_members` (unknown → recorded),
  due/priority verbatim, `identifier = linear_identifier`, `linear_raw` = full payload **incl.
  the issue's existing comment thread** (rendered read-only in the activity feed — pre-B3
  comment history is NEVER imported into live card threads: it would double-count the mirrored
  copies of card comments and its synthesized shapes would trip the `is_tweak` legacy default;
  the §8.1 comment metric consequently covers only engine-tracked comments).
- **Delivery links:** parse trailing delivery-link comments (`drive.google.com` / `f.io`) →
  `file_url`.

### 5.2 Archive pull → `linear_archive`

Full history (~17.5k closed + excluded open), verbatim; legacy states, ghost authors, deleted
ids, aliases, dormant teams all expected and stored as-is. **Rate budget (critic add):** the pull
shares Linear's API budget with the still-live production bridges — paginate with resume tokens,
hard cap ≤ 4 req/s, run off-hours, expect a multi-hour-to-day job; the B1 gate plan allows for
it. **Image rescue:** download `uploads.linear.app` images referenced by operational
briefs/comments into the private Drive folder, rewrite stored references; archive images
best-effort with per-row gap notes.

### 5.3 Clients + team_members

§3 + corrected sources: Video Editors tab (names/emails only — **no Slack ids there**), the
hardcoded Slack fallback map inside n8n `TJVMyfwl85qrFGeK`, `WL_VIDEO_EDITORS` (Linear UUIDs),
`WL_ALLOWED_GRAPHICS`, manual Rocío Perez row, 7 SMMs from the SMM tab, admin rows.
`default_for_team` = today's hardcoded graphics auto-assignee.

### 5.4 Card linkage backfill

Resolve card link URLs (direct or alias) → set both card columns + deliverable `card_id`/
`origin`. Unresolvable links → B1 repair report. Linkage then stays current via §4.3.5.

### 5.5 Safety

Pre-B1 snapshot per ROLLBACK rule 4 (git tag `pre-B1`, official Linear export → private Drive,
Supabase dump). Only new tables are written. Every backfill row events `source='backfill'`.
"Only new tables" explicitly INCLUDES the additive `clients` / `team_members` reconciliation
inserts of §5.3 — those are Track B tables and their rows MUST land **before** `deliverables`
(FK dependency), or the backfill rejects real work. Insertion order is derived from the FK
graph: `clients` → `team_members` → `batches` → `deliverables` → `deliverable_events`.

### 5.6 Constraint preflight (MANDATORY before the first backfill write)

*Added 2026-07-06 after the clients-FK near-miss: the audit had found the facts (85 operational
issues under client slugs absent from `clients`, 60 of them project-less), but no step traced
those facts to their schema consequences, and the backfill would have failed or silently dropped
rows. The fix is mechanical, not editorial:*

Before the first write, the backfill tooling must enumerate **every constraint on every target
table** — each foreign key, NOT NULL, CHECK (status enum, team, kind), and unique index across
`batches` / `deliverables` / `deliverable_events` / `linear_archive` / `mirror_outbox` — and
compute, **from the real pulled data**, the violation count for each, plus a written handling
rule for every non-zero count. Expected classes (non-exhaustive — the sweep is the point):
missing client rows; assignees not in `team_members` (ghost/departed users → NULL + note, or
inactive member rows); sub-issues whose parent is completed / out-of-window / absent (→ the
§5.1 synthetic-batch rule); state names outside the §2.1 enum; duplicate `linear_issue_id`;
card-linkage rows whose card client ≠ deliverable client. The preflight report is a required
**B1 gate addendum**; the backfill runs only after every non-zero count has an approved rule.
A violation discovered mid-run is a stop-and-report, never a silent drop.

The full assumption sweep that motivated this section lives in
`docs/audits/2026-07-06-data-assumption-sweep.md` — 12 ranked items. Items 1/2/5/6/7/8 there
are covered by this mechanical preflight; items 3/9/10/11/12 are semantic and are hereby
attached to their phase gates (9 → B0.5 canary evidence; 11 → B1 backfill; 3/10 → B3 gate;
12 → B4 flip checklist).

**Scope of the blocking gate vs. the Linear rate budget.** The constraint gate needs only
**issue-level** fields — assignee id, state name, parent status, team, project/client, and
link resolution — all obtained in ONE paginated issue pass that fits inside Linear's hourly cap
(§5.2: ≤ 4 req/s, separate API key from the live bridges so it never starves production status
sync). **Comment-dependent checks do NOT block the gate:** item 11 (which trailing drive/f.io
comment is the delivery link) and any comment-author check are per-issue-comment reads that blow
the rate budget, and they are data-*quality* refinements, not constraint violations. Run them as
a **separate, best-effort pass** (off-hours, resumable) whose result annotates the backfill but
does not gate it. If comments can't be swept in time, the backfill proceeds with the constraint
gate satisfied and `file_url` filled best-effort, flagged for later repair — never blocked.

---

## 6. Auth — build first (B0)

Three role keys via the `client-credentials` pattern: `X-Syncview-Key` (timing-safe) +
`X-Syncview-Actor`. The header plumbing already reaches every write; B0 makes EFs **enforce and
persist** it (today's samples EF drops actor/role — measured; Track B EFs must not).

- `ROLE_KEY_ADMIN` — Sidney + Kasper.
- `ROLE_KEY_SMM` — calendar/samples writes, batch creation, assignment, approvals.
- `ROLE_KEY_CREATIVE` — deliverable status/delivery/comments on own team's work; no approvals
  for Kasper/client, no batch creation, no `client_access`.

**6.1 Login UX.** One modal: role key + **name picked from the `team_members` roster** (not free
text — a typo would silently empty "My issues" views and mis-attribute the ledger) → localStorage
→ sent on every EF write. **Tab visibility** (B2 "role-gated"): presence of a stored role key
shows the tab (cosmetic, spoofable, accepted — reads are anon anyway); a lightweight
`key-verify` EF ping at boot validates the key and resolves the member row (editor's team for
"my work" views; mismatch ⇒ treated as no key). Server-side enforcement remains write-time.

**6.2 Rollout — including the missing prerequisite the critics caught (B0.5).** Track A left all
three `*_ef_clients` flags TEST-only, so today **~0% of real production writes flow through the
EFs** — which would make the permissive-key log vacuous and the ledger/name-sync/anomaly claims
false for exactly the rows that matter. Therefore:
- **B0.5 (its own gated step, Track A canary discipline):** first fix the two known blockers
  (bulk-import verify reads the unmirrored n8n/Sheet path — false-fails for EF clients; EF
  reorder has no n8n fallback), then roll `calendar_upsert_ef_clients`,
  `sample_review_ef_clients`, `settings_ef_clients` to **all real clients**, client-by-client,
  each with the one-flag rollback. Gate: 1 week all-clients-on-EF with zero regressions.
- Only then does the §6.2 permissive window start counting: role keys **permissive** (missing
  key ⇒ allowed + logged) until the log shows **zero unkeyed writes for 72 h over real-client
  traffic**, then flip `auth_enforcement` to enforced (§1.6 flip point).
- **Retire the open n8n card-write doors at B5** (§13.4.h): once all clients are EF-routed and
  baked, the unauthenticated `calendar-upsert-post`/`sample-review-upsert`/reorder webhooks are
  deactivated — until then, fail-closed tokens coexist with those legacy doors (accepted,
  time-boxed, stated).

**6.3 Actor is the audit trail** (D7): every ledger row carries who/role/when; §2.6 guarantees a
row even for rogue writers.

**6.4 Client review links — mint, don't move; verify server-side.** The sheet column never
existed; 0/29 tokens; the gate fails open today. B0: mint per-client tokens into `client_access`;
ship **`client-token-verify` EF** (`{slug, token}` → boolean + an access-log event) — the FE
client-link boot calls it (result cached per session) because the FE can no longer compare
locally (tokens are service-role-only). Client **writes** call the same EFs with
`X-Syncview-Client-Token`, validated against `client_access`, scoped to that client's rows and
client-legal transitions only (D4 rows 8–10). Then: re-issue fresh links per client via SMMs;
gate = every active client has a token-validated access-log event; **then** flip fail-open →
fail-closed (one flag). Fail-closed UX is an in-app screen ("ask your SMM for a fresh link" —
note: a static GitHub-Pages SPA cannot emit a real HTTP 410; it's a rendered state), and the
same screen replaces the view when an already-open tab's EF calls start returning 401/410.

**6.5 Future upgrade (documented, deferred):** per-person Supabase Auth + per-client RLS.

---

## 7. Reliability & disaster recovery

**7.1 Two independent backups — with the PITR truth told (§14 D-1).** The project is (per repo
docs) on the free tier, **where PITR does not exist**. Owner options: (a) upgrade to Pro + PITR
before B1 → RPO ≈ seconds (recommended); (b) stay free → RPO = the daily export. Either way:
daily export of all Track-B tables → private Drive folder (extend the weekly-backup workflow or
a GH Action) with a >26 h freshness alarm; the weekly full backup continues.

**7.2 Reconstruct-from-events.** §2.6 makes the ledger trustworthy; `scripts/replay-deliverables.js
--verify` ships with B1 and runs weekly in CI against a scratch schema (replay == state, or
alert).

**7.3 Linear as COLD FALLBACK through cutover:** B5 freezes but does not cancel; 8-week grace;
flip-back = `prod_authority` reversal.

**7.4 Degraded read-only mode:** SWR cache per team view; on Supabase read failure render cache +
amber banner, disable writes (never fake-save — the Samples-Old "Saved on device" silent local
fallback is the named anti-pattern), poll for recovery.

**7.5 Rehearsed restore** before B4: restore export (+ PITR if Pro) into a scratch project, run
replay-verify, time it (target RTO < 1 h). The drill artifact is a named B4 gate input.

**7.6 DR runbook in `ROLLBACK.md`:** symptom → fallback → steps → who to tell; §4.7 is its
skeleton. Written + rehearsed before B4.

---

## 8. Monitoring & observability (always-on)

**8.1 Continuous reconciler v2** (GH Actions + n8n trigger, ~10 min): per team, diff Linear ⇄
`deliverables` on status / assignee (**by raw Linear user id** — §1.4d) / due / title, plus the
**linkage lane** (cards with Linear links but no deliverable ids — §4.3.5) and the **comment
lane**: engine-tracked comments must map 1:1 by comment id recorded in event payloads —
pre-B3 history and `(via SyncView)` echoes explicitly excluded (§5.1, §4.2). Tolerances per
§1.4 (roller/+2d churn, clamped states). **It APPLIES corrections toward the authoritative side**
(within SAFETY_CAP ≈ 15, abort + page beyond) — alert-only would leave webhook-missed changes
unhealed, and Linear's redelivery is bounded (§4.7). Also verifies both Linear webhooks are still
**enabled** (Linear can auto-disable after sustained failures). Every correction = ledger row
(`source='reconcile'`) + Slack. **Restarts the dead samples lane** (measured: samples reconcile
is not running today). **Excludes `clients.kind='test'` rows from alerting** (QA harness traffic
must not page the owner at 3am — probes stamp a reserved actor; a "monitoring quiet during
overnight run" checklist item lands in B2/B3).

**8.2 Health checks** (Slack on breach): writes landing; realtime alive; `sync_state='error'`
== 0; outbox depth < 20 / oldest < 30 min; backup freshness < 26 h; replay-verify weekly green;
flags valid; **webhook enabled-state probe**; n8n `errorWorkflow` wired on the transition-
critical workflows (measured: the error-alert workflow exists but is attached to NOTHING — B0
checklist item).

**8.3 Ledger anomaly scans** (meaningful thanks to §2.6): actorless events; zero-event
deliverables; repeated mirror retries; `foreign_write_detected`; same-field flapping; events
from sources illegal for the current phase/team.

**8.4 Admin dashboard** (admin role): per-team authority, drift count, outbox depth, last-backup
age, error rates, reconciler last-run, flag-flip history, **both FE outbox depths + role-key
status per browser** (the §1.5.2 drain evidence).

**8.5 Harness lanes:** `master-test`/`overnight-test` gain Production-tab lanes (§12).

---

## 9. Creation & interaction flows (LOGIC — the locked design's wiring contract)

The current-state truth is the four logic maps; the **transition table**
(`2026-07-05-logic-reviews.md` §D4) is normative for EF role gating. **The write EFs are named:**
`deliverable-write` and `batch-write` (thin HTTP wrappers over the §2.6 RPCs; payload = op-level
patches modeled on the SXR EF contract: `{id?, patch, expected_status?, expected_updated_at?,
source}` + the §6 headers; response `{ok, row}` / `{ok:false, conflict:true, row}` — same
envelope family the FE already speaks).

**9.1 Creating a card → deliverable(s).** Batch picker + "new batch"; deliverables stamped
`origin`, `card_id`, `kind`; one sample = up to TWO deliverables. In B3, creation still flows
intake→Linear and mirrors in; from B4 the card/intake creates natively and the mirror pushes.
**Split-authority window (critic add):** intake requests split per deliverable team — the
Supabase-authoritative leg creates its batch row + deliverable natively FIRST; the
Linear-authoritative leg goes through the legacy intake and, when its parent/sub-issues mirror
in, the inbound engine **adopts them into the existing batch row** by `linear_parent_ids`
matching (title+client match fallback) rather than minting a second batch. The native side owns
the SMM Slack notification; the n8n leg keeps writing the Sheets submissions log while it
exists. **Auto-assign:** port Pick Freest Editor with three *deliberate* refinements (they are
improvements, not parity bugs — do not "fix" them back during parity testing): count only
`video`-team deliverables (was: all teams under the SMM's key), exclude `duplicate` from load
(was: included), ties by stable member order (was: API order). Graphics = `default_for_team`.
Claude-generated graphics titles: §14 D-5. **AI-thumbnail chain: verified disconnected dead code
— do not port** (D-5 confirms).

**9.2 The card's two link buttons + the FOUR link-keyed predicates.** Each card's two slots
resolve through authority (Linear URL ↔ `?prod=1&d=<id>`) via the choke points
`_calLinearUrlFor` / `_sxrLinearUrlFor`. At each team's flip, re-point ALL FOUR link-keyed
predicate families from `linear_issue_id` columns to `*_deliverable_id`: (1) the status-pill
LOCK ("Link a Linear sub-issue first"), (2) the dupe-link warning, (3) the "link the sub-issue"
nudges, (4) **the Kasper-queue visibility gates** (`_calCompKasperVisible` + samples twins —
missed, these silently hide every new thumbnail from Kasper review). Paste-guards → deliverable
picker (DB uniqueness). Plus a **"create missing deliverable" affordance**: a card slot with no
deliverable (e.g. the graphic slot of a half-linked B3-era sample) offers "create thumbnail
deliverable in batch …" post-flip. No four-button period.

**9.3 Back-link + origin label** (unchanged): "open source card" + **"Sample"** /
**"Off-calendar"** tags.

**9.4 Name interconnection (one value, two surfaces).** The YouTube title IS
`calendar_posts.name`; sync = deliverable.title == card.name, keyed on EF-committed writes
(ledger), never FE optimistic state. **Loop terminator + stale-write guard (critic add):** a
rename is ONE EF transaction that updates both card `name` and deliverable `title` and emits ONE
ledger event (`title_change`) — there is no second-hop propagation write to terminate; and
`name` writes carry a base-value compare (apply only if caller's base matches current), closing
the stale-tab / bulk-import-replay revert (the `name`∉`_CAL_ROLLBACK_FIELDS` caveat). During B3
the mirror stores Linear titles verbatim; name-sync activates per team at B4; legacy mismatches
get a badge + one-time report, no mass rename (D-13).

**9.5 Comments/notes — single-writer design (ratify D-6).** Card component threads
(`video_tweaks`/`graphic_tweaks`) remain **the single store** for card-linked deliverables; the
Production tab's activity feed renders and writes that same thread (via the **existing card EFs**
— `calendar-upsert` / `sample-review-upsert` field-level comment patches, so the merge RPCs and
the **card event ledgers** keep working exactly as today; `comment_add` events for card-linked
rows land in `calendar_post_events`/`sample_review_events`, NOT double-logged into
`deliverable_events`). Editors get `role='editor'`, `audience='internal'`. Manual deliverables
use `deliverables.comments` + `deliverable_merge_comments`; batches use `batches.comments` +
`batch_merge_comments`. Caption/title threads stay card-local (no deliverable exists — verified).
**Corrected mirror premise (critic add):** today only Notes-modal messages + request-change
bodies mirror to Linear; review-panel plain comments and Kasper's comment-only adds are
deliberately app-only ("plain notes don't ping the editor"). The transition mirror **preserves
exactly today's mirrored set** — it does not start pushing the app-only classes. Inbound Linear
comments per §4.3.3 with echo filtering per §4.2. After cutover the Linear leg drops.

**9.6 Assignment & due date:** single-row writes; the calendar card shows the editor chip via
`*_deliverable_id → deliverables → team_members`.

**9.7 Delivery flows preserved:** video = frame.io folder on the batch + status →
`smm_approval`; graphics = Drive folder on batch + per-deliverable `file_url`. A pasted link in
a comment offers "set as delivery link".

**9.8 URGENT + notifications:** re-point from the n8n Linear-resolution flow to the §11 notify
EF reading `team_members.slack_user_id` (the sheet never had Slack ids). Same confirm/latch UX.

**9.9 Kasper Messages inbox:** built on card threads + `kasper_seen` — §9.5 keeps it working
unchanged, now also showing editor replies. No rebuild.

**9.10 Workload tab re-point** (per team at flip): read `deliverables` (+`team_members`) for
flipped teams; CON/STR filtered; realtime can finally turn ON (row-level writes); allowlists retire into
`team_members`.

**9.11 `editors-week` replacement (B5) — corrected semantics (critic catch):** a "delivery" is a
transition **INTO a review state** (`smm_approval|kasper_approval|client_approval`) **FROM a work
state** (`in_progress|todo|backlog|tweak`) — NOT "entering approved/posted" (that measures
client/Kasper approvals, not editor labor). Per assignee, de-bounced to ≤1 per (Chicago-day,
kind) per deliverable, with the tweak-vs-firstcut split (from-state `tweak` ⇒ tweak-delivery).
Ship as a saved query behind the Kasper Editors subtab before retiring the webhook.

## 10. UI — the Production tab (DESIGN LOCKED — `docs/syncview-design/`)

Prototype status: pixel/behavior parity done (11 adversarial re-audits, last six 0-high;
138-assertion suite). Build = rebuild into the repo (`_prod*` — verified free) and wire to real
data.

**10.1 Data contract mapping:**

| Prototype structure | Real source |
|---|---|
| `ISSUES` rows `{id, team, project, title, parent, status, assignee, due, created, sub:[done,total], desc, file, comments}` | `deliverables` (+ batch join); `file` = `file_url`/batch folder; `comments` = §9.5 thread |
| `PROJECTS` `{name, emoji, team}` | `clients` (`emoji` column; board membership derived per team) |
| `EDITORS` `{name, init, color}` | `team_members` (`avatar_color`) |
| `STATUS` / `STATUS_ORDER` | **same 13-status set, DIFFERENT keys** — the prototype uses `prog`/`smm`/`kasper`/`client` where the DB stores `in_progress`/`smm_approval`/`kasper_approval`/`client_approval` (other 9 match). The rebuild renames the prototype keys to the §2.1 slugs, and the ported test-suite selectors are adapted to match (§12) — do NOT feed DB slugs into unrenamed prototype lookups |
| `CLIENTS` project-board cards `{status(PSTATUS), lead, target, desc}` | `clients.board_status` / `lead_member_id` / `target_date` / `board_desc` (§2.2 — these are WRITABLE in the locked design: pickers + drag; writes go through `batch-write`-style EF ops on `clients`, evented as `board_change`) |
| `TODAY = new Date(2026,6,4)`, `DRIVE` const | real clock; real links (mock scaffolding — no mock data ships) |

**10.2 Async is a new surface:** loading/skeleton/error/stale states via the SXR module's SWR +
optimistic patterns (the canonical clone template).

**10.3 Identifier display (D-7 — corrected by the critics):** backfilled rows show their
original `linear_identifier`. Native minting uses **per-team Postgres sequences created at each
team's B4 flip, seeded = live Linear max at flip + 5,000 margin** (never a constant written in a
spec — Linear's counters advance ~100/wk/team and would cross any pre-picked number during B3),
with a flip-checklist assertion that the seed range collides with nothing in
`linear_archive.identifier` or `deliverables.linear_identifier` (§1.5.9).

**10.4 Deep links:** `?prod=1&d=<id>` (detail), `?prod=1&team=<t>` (list/board).

**10.5 Kept/removed** (unchanged): no priority/labels/cycles/inbox/triage-nav/manual new-issue;
Triage *status* kept for migrated data. Light theme now.

**10.6 The behavioral test suites are NOT in this repo** — `behav.js`/`qa-features.js`/`sweep.js`
+ the parity-audit workflow live on the design machine only. **This is an OWNER action, not a
build-session task (D-17): copy them into `docs/syncview-design/tests/` before B2.** The B2 gate
depends on it.

**10.7 Still to wire** (with owners): §9.2–9.3 links/labels/predicates; §9.4 name-sync; §9.5
threads; §6 role gating + D4 transition enforcement; realtime; §9.1 intake; §9.10 workload;
reorder persistence (`sort_key`); archive view (**read-only surface over `linear_archive` via a
role-gated EF** — the table is service-role-only, §2.7); the **staff diagnostic page** (both FE
outbox depths incl. the new `peekSxrLinearOutbox()` helper, role-key status, flag/authority
state, `min_app_version`) — it is the named evidence mechanism for §1.5 steps 2/5.

---

## 11. Notifications

Slack now, behind one `notify` EF (ro.am-swappable). Fires on: deliverable assigned, status →
`tweak` (with tweak text), status → `smm_approval`, URGENT. Every send logs an event. **Owner
input (D-14):** what does Linear's native project→Slack integration post today (~51 projects
carry `slackChannelId`) — which of it must the notify EF replicate so client channels don't go
quiet at B5? Editors also lose Linear's own inbox at cutover; the assigned/tweak notifications
are the replacement — confirm sufficiency with the pilot team during B3.

---

## 12. Testing & verification

- **Probe suite** (`qa/` SXR pattern, TEST client + TEST Linear project only): batch create →
  auto-assign → full §D4 status walk incl. undo → delivery links → editor chip on card → ledger
  row for every step (incl. raw-write trigger check §2.6) → notify fired (test channel).
- **Role/token matrix:** 3 keys × every write op; client token × scope × legal/illegal
  transitions; permissive vs enforced; `key-verify` behavior.
- **Sync/mirror drills:** loop prevention; **B3 comment-echo probe (the legacy mirror + Comments
  webhook running together — assert each app comment appears exactly once)**; B4 echo-drop
  (strict AND); per-team isolation; **two-writer race** (concurrent conflicting transitions →
  one 409, no silent overwrite); alias move; webhook delete; clamped-state tolerance; **the full
  §1.5 flip checklist executed on the TEST client via `prod_authority_client_overrides`**
  (team-level flags never flip in production for a drill — critic catch), including outbox-drain
  evidence and the detect-only straggler alert.
- **Migration dry-run** (B1 gate): counts vs audit numbers; 20-issue spot parity; repair queue;
  idempotency (second run = zero changes); rate-budget compliance.
- **DR drill** (§7.5) + replay-verify green.
- **Behavioral parity:** the design-kit suites (once in-repo, D-17) re-run against the wired tab
  with selectors adapted to the renamed status keys (§10.1).
- `npm test` + `qa/master.js` green throughout; no renames of the 11 grabFunc-extracted symbols
  until §13 retires the reconcilers.
- **Track A latent bugs fixed in B0.5** (bulk-import verify; EF reorder fallback) — verified by
  probes before any real client is flagged.

---

## 13. Cutover & teardown (B5)

1. Both teams flipped and stable; intake native; outbound mirror keeps Linear current; grace
   period begins (Linear frozen-but-live, detect-only inbound alerting).
2. Grace (target 8 weeks) with §8 green + one flip-back drill.
3. Verify archive completeness (counts vs export; image-rescue report) + private full Linear
   export in Drive.
4. Retire in order (each reversible until step 7; **private-Drive export + public status stub
   before every n8n edit** — §1.6):
   a. outbound mirror off;
   b. Linear webhooks deleted + inbound EF retired;
   c. `MJbMZ789B5ExZz9x` deactivated — verify first that the A1/A2 flag routing inside it is
      moot (all real clients on EFs since B0.5);
   d. both reconcile scripts + Actions + n8n triggers;
   e. `Workload — Reconcile` + `workload_issues` (tab reads `deliverables`);
   f. VIDEO PRODUCTION AUTOMATION's Linear branches;
   g. `linear-set-status`, `linear-add-comment`, `linear-subissues`, `linear-issue-statuses`,
      `linear-tweak-comments`, `editors-week` (→ §9.11 query). (The nightly due-date roller is
      NOT in this family — n8n was eliminated by measurement; it dies only via D-9.)
   h. **the unauthenticated legacy card-write webhooks** (`calendar-upsert-post`,
      `sample-review-upsert`, reorders — deactivate now that all clients are EF-routed; this is
      the moment §6.4's "closes the unauthenticated write path" claim becomes fully true);
   i. FE: Linear push/outbox/reassert/point-adoption/bulk-link code removed; link columns stay,
      inert.
5. **Secrets teardown:** rotate the house Linear key (hardcoded in 6+ workflows); the 7 per-SMM
   keys + sheet column are handled at D-15 (**now**, not B5); rotate the Anthropic key if D-5
   ports the title generator.
6. Mirror-tab cleanup per §3 owner list.
7. **Only after** grace + verified archive + owner sign-off: cancel Linear.

---

## 14. Gates & open decisions

**Hard gates** (evidence + owner sign-off, ROLLBACK rule 6). Every phase also: rule-4 snapshot
before start + ROLLBACK.md Live State updated in the same PR (§1.6).
- **B0 →**: vocabulary ratified (D-2); tokens minted + `client-token-verify` live; flags
  trigger + `flag_flips` live; n8n errorWorkflow wired (§8.2).
- **B0.5 →**: Track A latent bugs fixed; all real clients on all three EF flags for 1 week,
  zero regressions; THEN permissive-key log clean 72 h over real traffic → enforced.
- **B1 →**: dry-run counts match audit; **constraint preflight (§5.6) posted with every
  non-zero violation count carrying an approved handling rule**; 20-issue spot parity; repair
  queue + `active=false` list reviewed (D-16); replay-verify green; CON/STR active split
  measured (D-11).
- **B2 →**: tab renders real migrated data behind `?prod=1` for admin; design-kit suites
  in-repo (D-17) and green on the wired tab; staff diagnostic page live.
- **B3 →**: comments webhook subscribed + catch-up pull run (§4.3.4); mirror zero-diff (modulo
  §1.4) 7 consecutive days; echo probe green (§12); editor/SMM UX feedback collected.
- **B3→B4 per team**: §1.5 checklist artifacts (outbox drain, zero-diff + linkage-zero report,
  legacy-writer gates verified incl. reconcilers + n8n bridges, identifier seed check, flip +
  rollback rehearsal, detect-only alert tested) + **roller located AND disabled (D-9 — with the
  fallback below)** + editor/SMM sign-off + DR drill done.
- **B4→B5**: 2 full batch cycles per team, zero lost/wrong statuses; reconciler v2 quiet;
  owner sign-off.
- **B5 end**: grace green + archive verified before cancellation.

**Open decisions for the owner:**

| # | Decision | Context | Recommendation | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | PITR add-on: yes/no/when | **Owner confirmed Pro plan 2026-07-05** (good — daily backups + 7-day retention already included). PITR costs **$100/mo (7-day)** + requires Small compute (~$5/mo net after Pro credits) — it's billed **prorated to the hour**, which enables a cheap middle path | (a) NOW: add a free 6-hourly export (GH Action) → RPO ≤ 6 h; (b) enable PITR **temporarily** around the risky windows only (B1 backfill days, each B4 flip week) and disable after — prorated cost ≈ a few dollars per window; (c) revisit keeping PITR permanently at B5, when Linear stops being a live second copy. **APPROVED by owner 2026-07-05** ("enable it [per this plan]; I'm not going to pay $100/mo") — i.e. no permanent add-on; 6-hourly export ships in B0; PITR toggled on only for the named windows | B1 ✅ |
| D-2 | Ratify status slugs + mappings (§2.1), incl. the Triage no-op and the D-10 outbound split | three vocabularies measured | **RATIFIED by owner 2026-07-05** ("yeah okay, do that — smartly"). His follow-up question — should the CARD pills gain the Linear-only statuses (Backlog/Canceled/…)? — answered as specced: **no; cards keep today's 8-status review vocabulary unchanged** (zero behavior risk to the review flows); the Production tab carries the full 13; the projection shows Backlog/Todo/Triage as "In Progress" on cards exactly as the Linear sync does today. If SMMs later want a "not started yet" hint on cards, it can be added as a display badge without touching the vocabulary | B0 ✅ |
| D-3 | Priority: mirror-only (hidden) vs surfaced | in active use again; locked design has no priority UI | mirror-only + URGENT; revisit after pilot | B1 |
| D-4 | Pre-migration Linear cleanup (824 zombies + 336 stale-WIP) | §5.1 — **OPTIONAL**: the migration cutoff already sends old open issues to the archive, not the live board, so skipping this loses nothing; a cleanup only makes Linear itself tidier during the mirror phase | default = skip unless the owner wants Linear tidied; a ready-made issue list can be generated on request | — |
| D-5 | Intake extras: port Claude graphics-titles? confirm AI-thumbnail chain stays dead? | §9.1 | port titles via EF secret; thumbnails dead | B2 |
| D-6 | Ratify §9.5 single-writer comment design | card thread stays the store; Kasper inbox intact | as specced | B1 |
| D-7 | Deliverable display identifiers | §10.3 — seeds computed at flip, never constants | per-team sequences, seed = flip-time Linear max + 5,000 | B1 (design) / B4 (seed) |
| D-8 | Overdue: visible state, no auto-bump | old bumper half-dead + inconsistent | confirm | B2 |
| D-9 | Identify the ~23:45 UTC roller actor | NOT n8n (measured); owner says "certainly something we've done… probably the workload calendar." Signature narrowed 2026-07-05 from the bumped-cohort data: fires 23:45:0x–2x UTC with sub-second spacing; touches ONLY review-state issues (For SMM/Client approval, Tweak Needed) of active calendar clients; rolls due-today → tomorrow; the set shrinks night-over-night (15 → 2) — consistent with a script reading a stale external list, e.g. **an Apps Script bound to one of the Google Sheets** (owner's hunch fits). Owner's personal-account Apps Script checked 2026-07-05: only one unrelated trigger ("Kenya CV", last run 11:28 PM local — wrong time, unrelated). REMAINING checks: the same Triggers page while logged in as **sidney@synchrosocial.com** and **house@synchrosocial.com** (the sheets are owned by the workspace account, so a bound script would live there, not on the gmail account), the sheets' Extensions → Apps Script, and Linear Settings → API → personal keys/apps | still a B4 flip-gate item with the same fallback (rotate remaining personal Linear keys + scoped due-date tolerance in detect-only alerting) if not found | B4 |
| D-10 | In-Progress→Todo outbound asymmetry | §2.1 — split rule: legacy card path keeps it, deliverable-native maps straight | as specced | B0 |
| D-11 | CON/STR scope | §2.9 (measure active split at B1) | out of scope; archived at B5 | B1 |
| D-12 | Inbound comment-image fidelity | Linear image URLs expire | best-effort for new comments; rescue pass covers briefs | B3 |
| D-13 | Legacy title mismatches at B4 | §9.4 | badge + report, no mass rename | B4 |
| D-14 | Linear→Slack project integration replacement scope | §11 | owner inspects one channel | B3 |
| D-15 | Rotate the 7 public per-SMM Linear keys + remove the sheet column | publicly readable via gviz today | **DECLINED by owner 2026-07-05** ("I don't care about it") — risk accepted, same posture as D9 (hardcoded house key). Keys become moot at B5 when Linear is retired; the sheet column is still removed at §13.6 cleanup | — |
| D-16 | §3 owner review list (Coleman, Burch, terrinamar, junk quarantine) | §3 | — | B1 |
| D-17 | Copy the design-kit behavioral suites into the repo | **RESOLVED 2026-07-05**: owner shared the probe folder via Drive; `behav.js` (138 assertions), `qa-features.js`, `sweep.js`, `build.js`, and the parity-audit workflow are now committed at `docs/syncview-design/tests/` (with run + path-adaptation README). NOTE for owner: the shared Drive folder also contains `.linear-probe-profile` — a saved **Linear login session**; un-share the folder or delete that subfolder | B2 ✅ |
| D-18 | Mirror identity: dedicated Linear user seat vs OAuth-app actor | §4.2/§4.4 — must be distinct from sidney@ for echo-dropping | OAuth-app actor if available; else a machine user seat | B4 |

---

## 15. Planning process (how this doc gets to "perfect")

- ✅ Rewrite around locked decisions. ✅ Design delivered + folded in (§9/§10).
- ✅ **2026-07-05: the deep-audit + verification pass**: full live re-audit
  (`docs/audits/2026-07-05-*`), logic maps, every subsystem pressure-tested; corrections applied
  in place (sizing, tokens, PITR, status enum, card two-slot linkage, anon exposure, ledger
  enforceability, batch shapes, inbound scope, hidden writers, workload 4-team reality).
- ✅ **2026-07-05: adversarial critic pass** (4 independent lenses — execution-readiness /
  worst-case / consistency / fact-check); all confirmed findings folded in: legacy
  reconciler+webhook gating, the B0.5 real-client EF rollout phase, the B3 comment echo loop,
  client-token-verify, Kasper visibility gates, projects-board schema, flip-time identifier
  seeds, §2.6 transaction mechanics, CAS on deliverable writes, per-phase flip points, drill
  granularity, editors-week semantics, prototype status-key rename map, comment-history
  handling, archive privacy, QA/monitoring isolation, and the D-17/D-18 additions.
- ✅ **2026-07-06: the clients-FK near-miss → standing rule.** The B1 backfill preflight caught
  85 operational issues whose client slugs were absent from `clients` (the audit knew the facts;
  no step had traced them to their schema consequences). Lesson made permanent:
  **STANDING RULE — every phase's tooling must validate ALL schema constraints and referential
  closure against the real data before its first write** (§5.6 is the B1 instance; B2 card-wiring,
  B3's inbound writer, and B4's flip checklists each get the same treatment before they run).
  "Audit found the fact" is not enough — a machine check must connect facts to consequences.
- **NEXT:** owner answers §14 (D-15 immediately; D-1/D-2/D-4/D-6/D-17 before B0–B2); then the
  build session implements phase by phase under Track A's gate discipline. Everything stays in
  THIS doc + `docs/syncview-design/` + `docs/audits/` — no scattered new files.
