# App logic (`index.html`) — current truth

## Shape

One ~44k-line single-file SPA. Major surfaces: content calendar, samples (SXR + legacy),
three review flows (client / Kasper / SMM), Production tab (`?prod=1`), onboarding funnel,
sales intake, filming plans, thumbnails tooling, SMM weekly reports, TikTok pilot.

## Calendar

- End-to-end logic map: `docs/audits/2026-07-05-logic-calendar.md` (evidence);
  write path + contract: `docs/truth/SUPABASE.md`.
- Status pushes to Linear go through `_calPushStatusToLinear()` — **no guard** on
  Posted/Scheduled (they ARE pushed; a stale code comment claims otherwise).
- Status pills require a linked Linear sub-issue ("Link a Linear sub-issue first").

## Samples (SXR + legacy)

- Logic map: `docs/audits/2026-07-05-logic-samples.md`.
- SXR rejects pushing Scheduled/Posted to Linear (unlike calendar).
- `_sxrReassertLinearStatus()` is **defined but never called** (dead drift-protection);
  with the samples reconciler likely off (see `docs/truth/N8N.md`), SXR's only protections
  are a 5-minute local-fresh merge guard.
- SXR writes `kasper_finish_log` which is silently dropped server-side
  (see `docs/truth/SUPABASE.md`).

## Reviews (client / Kasper / SMM)

- The three flows as state machines + transition table:
  `docs/audits/2026-07-05-logic-reviews.md`.
- Linear comments are written prefixed `**{Reviewer} (via SyncView):**`.

## Linear sync surface

- Every consistency surface (status/assignee/due/name/comments), outboxes, flags:
  `docs/audits/2026-07-05-logic-sync.md`; current sync reality: `docs/truth/LINEAR.md`.

## Production tab (`?prod=1`)

- Read-only in-app Linear mirror; **guarded read-only by design** — no writes until a
  milestone explicitly enables them (Track B4).
- Boot does a lightweight parallel select of `clients`/`team_members`/`batches`/
  `deliverables` (plus `deliverable_events`).
- Design source of truth is the locked kit in `docs/syncview-design/`; UI changes must pass
  `npm run test:prod-polish`. Deep-links: `?prod=1`, `team`, `view`, `client`, `d` params.
- Foundation audit evidence: `docs/audits/2026-07-09-production-foundation-audit.md`.

## Deep-audit findings ledger (Phase 2, 2026-07-11 →)

Living section — findings land here with status tags: `[open]`, `[fixed <commit>]`,
`[wontfix <reason>]`.

### F1 `[open]` — 35 defined-but-unreferenced functions (dead-code candidates)

Found 2026-07-11 by an automated scan (`function foo(` / `const foo = (…)=>` definitions whose
name appears exactly once in `index.html`, cross-checked against `onclick=""` strings and
`scripts/`+`supabase/` for `grabFunc` extraction). `appUpdateNudge` was a 36th hit but is
referenced by `test/app-update-nudge.js`, so it is NOT dead and is excluded.

**Do not bulk-delete.** Several are likely staged-but-unwired feature work, not cruft — triage
per group before removing anything. Verify each is still unreferenced at removal time (this is a
fast-moving file). Confirmed-dead example already documented: `_sxrReassertLinearStatus()`.

| Group | Candidates |
|---|---|
| Calendar | `_calClientPossessive` `_calCommentTotal` `_calLinkLabel` `_calOnTextareaInput` `_calOnUrlInput` `_calOpenUrlField` `_calStatusChip` `_calZoomHintHtml` |
| Production tab (`?prod=1`) — **check active prod sprint before touching** | `_prodById` `_prodClientEmoji` `_prodIsBatchParent` `_prodOpenBatch` `_prodSetFocusCard` `_prodSetTeam` |
| Samples/SXR | `_sxrReassertLinearStatus` `_sxrReorderUrlForClient` `_sxrSetAllSettable` |
| Onboarding | `_obAddCreatorRow` `_obToggle` `_obvToggle` |
| Market-research tab (looks unwired) | `_mrHookBadge` `renderMRTab_landscape` `renderMRTab_topics` |
| Client credentials | `_ccKnownClientOptions` `_ccOpenBulkImport` |
| SMM | `_smApprovalSummary` `setSmMode` |
| Workload | `wlAddDays` `wlWeekMondayISO` |
| Misc | `_filmsParseSheet` `_kasperIsReviewMounted` `_tplViewLink` `generateBrief` `mBlockDiff` `setGainMode` |

Repro: a name-occurrence scan (count `\bNAME\b` matches in `index.html`; flag names appearing
once). Next audit chunks: duplicate literals,
`console.log` left in prod paths, inconsistent status-string handling, and large inline handlers.
