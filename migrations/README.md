# `migrations/` — manually applied Supabase SQL

Every file here is a **one-time migration intended for manual application in the
Supabase SQL editor**. Applied files are kept for provenance; a newly added delta
can remain source-only until `EXECUTION_LOG.md` records its actual application.
There is no auto-runner: nothing in CI, `supabase/config.toml`, or `scripts/`
executes these files (see `README.md` › Repository layout).

## How to read this folder

- **`live-schema-baseline-2026-07-03.sql`** is the authoritative reconstruction
  point: a schema-only snapshot of the live database captured 2026-07-03. To
  rebuild from scratch, start here.
- **Dated files (`YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.sql`)** are deltas. Files dated after
  2026-07-03 apply **on top of** the baseline; earlier dated files are already
  folded into it and remain as history.
- **`2026-07-11-b4-linear-outbound.sql`** additively expands the dormant B1
  outbox, seeds the default-off outbound switch, and installs atomic enqueue /
  TEST-quarantine helpers. It does not flip authority or enable Linear writes.
- **`2026-07-12-production-comments.sql`** adds the normalized native/Linear
  comment store, service-only idempotent writer, protected body-bearing event
  snapshots, and the staff-reader data contract. It does not change authority,
  outbound flags, or Linear state.
- **`2026-07-12-write-ui-outbox-parity.sql`** marks server-authenticated
  legacy-parity outbox intents, seeds their independent reversible kill gate,
  and adds the atomic normalized-comment + outbox writer used by the Write-UI
  gateway. Existing authority and outbound-mode flag values are untouched.
- **`2026-07-14-thumbnail-revision-v2.sql`** revokes direct browser access to
  raw thumbnail revision metadata, seeds the default-off comparison/refresh
  gate, adds active Drive-thumbnail watcher/refresh triggers and bounded repair,
  and defines a locked service-role-only revision-rotation RPC. Dormant watcher
  placeholders may be seeded, but it does not enable Drive scanning, comparison
  delivery, or source-row mutation for any client.
- **`2026-07-14-f88-safe-sensitive-read-revocations.sql`** repeatably removes anon SELECT only
  from the backend/protected-reader safe subset: thumbnail revision metadata, both SMM weekly-
  report tables, and filming plans. It intentionally does not touch `clients` or the other raw
  tables still read by the SPA.
- **`2026-07-14-linear-intake-receipts.sql`** adds the service-only F44
  Calendar-to-Linear receipt ledger, team-scoped payload-hash receipt key, and
  monotonic retry/progress guards. It does not create Linear work or change
  workflow authority by itself.
- **`2026-07-15-pto-tracker.sql`** adds the three service-role-only PTO tables,
  per-member state-version triggers, transactional approval RPCs, and a live-floating-holiday
  uniqueness guard; it seeds `pto_v1` off. It contains no member/HR seed data and does not prove
  the migration was applied or the Edge Function deployed. Keep it off until the individual staff
  session prerequisite in `docs/features/PTO_TRACKER.md` is closed.
- **Undated feature files (`*-migration.sql`)** predate the dated convention
  (June 2026, originally at the repo root). Their schema is also already part of
  the baseline; each is documented by its owning design doc in `docs/features/`.

## Rules

- New migrations use the dated convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-slug>.sql`.
- **Additive-only** during the independence migration — new tables/columns are
  fine; `DROP`/`RENAME`/type changes are forbidden until final cleanup
  (`ROLLBACK.md` rule 3).
- After applying a migration, log it in `EXECUTION_LOG.md` (`ROLLBACK.md`
  rule 5).
